# Experience

## Chairman

`BUSINESS AND INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY SOCIETY, MANCHESTER METROPOLITAN STUDENTS' UNION`  
`MAR 2023 —`

I founded and I am now chairing the Business and Information Technology Society at The Union, Manchester Metropolitan University. In my role, I lead the committee of the society, set out our strategic direction and oversee day-to-day activities. I developed the society’s brand identity and I am facilitating projects to enhance our members’ experience at the University.

## Course Representative

`MANCHESTER METROPOLITAN STUDENTS' UNION`  
`SEP 2022 —`

As a course representative on my programme within the Faculty of Business and Law, I collect, aggregate and analyse course-related feedback from students. I address this feedback with staff, via the appropriate departments and channels and communicate outcomes to students. In this role, I have also worked to promote the adoption of inclusive curriculum practices.

## Financial Caseworker

`CAPITA PLC. (NHS BUSINESS SERVICES AUTHORITY, PCSE)`  
`JUN 2021 — AUG 2021`

While Capita was undergoing a digital transformation, I was recruited on one of the teams which ensured minimised disruption caused by the transition from legacy systems. I processed a high volume of cases where clients’ patient accounts required adjustments. As the role involved using legacy systems which could not validate manually entered information, exceptional attentiveness in the handling of financial information was required. Maintaining accuracy, investigating complex cases, communicating outcomes to clients and resolving inconsistencies in data were key aspects of this role.
