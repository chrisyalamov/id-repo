> Pureheart is a fictional charitable organisation.

This project, requiring the design and development of a website for Pureheart, was part of a university assignment (on a Business Technology course at Manchester Metropolitan University) which took place during the first semester of the 2022/23 academic year.

# Design and development

When planning this project, I sought to create a UI that is breathable and easy to navigate, while maintaining visual consistency and implementing good UI/UX principles.

# Animation and interactivity
