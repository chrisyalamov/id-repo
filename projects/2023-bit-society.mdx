> During my time at Manchester Metropolitan, I decided to start an academic society for students with an interest in business and technology.

I developed a brand identity for the society, which encompasses the values and goals I and my committee shared.

![Brand guidelines for the society](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/chrisyalamov/id-repo/main/src/projects/2023-bit-society/A4_25_d096bc87da.jpg)

The Society has two logos— a primary abstract logo mark and "The Capsule"— a visual mark, intended to blend contemporary art styles with the heraldric concept of a coat of arms (or crest). The Capsule contains various elements which capture some of the foundational values of the society.

# Development

However, a brand goes far beyond just a logo. To preserve the society's messaging and identity past mine and my commitee's elected terms, I am doing two things: I have developed a set of brand guidelines which set out important details about our visual identity, tone of voice and aims; I am also in the process of creating Capsule, a design system which makes adhering to the brand guidelines seamless by providing atomic components for various use cases.

# Brand in action

We have used the brand guidelines and resources to design content for social media.

We have also applied those guidelines to other digital and print promotional material, such as slide decks and leaflets.
