# Brief
The Equality Network (tEN) was a project set up across the Olympus Academy Trust in South Gloucestershire in 2017. Its aims were to—
- take an educational rather than disciplinary approach towards discriminatory attitudes within the trust 
- create a safe space for members of minority groups 
- educate members of minorities about their rights under the Equality Act 2010 

The project needed a modern, friendly and exciting brand identity which would help them establish trust among members of minorities, but also establish authority and a sense of professionalism.

## Setting the scene

- tEN's audience  
The Equality Network was based within the Olympus Academy Trust, a partnership of several primary, secondary schools and sixth form colleges. This meant their audience mostly consisted of students, aged 16-20.
- tEN's messaging pillars  
The Equality Network's key messaging revolved around several main points— respect for differences, zero tolerance (but patience) towards discriminatory attitudes and importance of education on issues surrounding diversity and inclusion, as well as relevant history.
- Organisational context  
tEN was an internal project which didn't have a commercial purpose, meaning that competitor analysis was not applicable. However, the context in which tEN was being set up— an educational environment, in some cases involving very young people— informed the development of the brand, particularly its tone of voice. It was important to consider the emotional response messaging could invoke among younger groups.

# Development and outcome
Over 4 weeks, with feedback from the members of the Equality Network, I developed a brand image which encompassed their core values and character.

A set of brand guidelines which governed not just visual identity, but the network's messaging in general, were also delivered. Using those, we developed several campaigns and resources.

The guidelines were also applied to stationery and internal communications
