Building a brand for yourself is a challenging task. In fact, I'd confidently place it as the single most difficult project I have worked on as a designer.

**But why?**

When tasked with 'creating an identity,' as a designer, you are presented with a client brief. Their 'values' and 'culture' define the 'identity' with which they want to be perceived— your only job then becomes translating from vision to visuals. But trying to come up with a vision for yourself is a whole other challenge.

# Stage 1: Discovery I

The first few attempts I made at crafting my portfolio were, in hindsight, a "discovery" phase. I was trying out different tools, technologies and styles to try and figure out which ones (if any) would fit.

Looking back, although these projects were fun, they acted more as sandboxes for trying out new things (like TailwindCSS). They lacked planning (or much thought, in fact) and were never really intended to be the final product.

# Stage 2: Discovery II

Once I had a better idea of what kind of stack I'd want to use for building my portfolio, I began to think about what I truly wanted it to convey— namely, some of the visual styles I had drawn inspiration from.

This kicked off a long phase of collecting anything I came across that I liked the look of, then trying to replicate it in Figma. The result? A strange amalgamation of various styles that lacked much harmony and vaguely resembled my Dribbble/Bēhance feed.

# Stage 3: Narrowing

After creating a design, building it in React, and subsequently realising it 'looks off' (and going around that loop many times), I began to rethink what I wanted my portfolio to showcase, and why I was even building it in the first place.

## Style

One of the domains of design I have been very influenced by is transportation and wayfinding design— the result of deliberate decisions and consideration of user needs and accessibility.

'Wayfinding at Schiphol' by Paul Mijksenaar details some of the design principles of the VI System which governs signage design at Schiphol Airport in Amsterdam. What the system achieves so well is wayfinding which stands out, even in a context of information overload.

This was a theme I wanted to also incorporate into my portfolio.

## Purpose

Perhaps the bigger problem I was facing was that I was developing a portfolio for the purpose of selling myself. The way I structured content and the way I presented it visually, was with the intention of impressing a potential client.

Showcasing many different styles in one, including a CTA on almost every page and focusing on making projects appear impressive led to a portfolio that was messy, cluttered and not representative of my work.

Instead, I focused on creating an 'archive'— a repository of my work with no other purpose than to simply showcase it. 

# Stage 4: Final.html... FinalFINALfinal01_02_final.html

After rethinking some of the aspects of what it was I was trying to build, I made a new prototype.

Was this the final product? By no means.

And although it was still making some of the same mistakes as previous versions, it was a clear step up in terms of quality and cohesion.

# The final product (for now) and key takeaways

Taking some of the improved aspects, I arrived at the final product— the one you're looking at right now. In the process of getting here, I learned a few important lessons:

## Scope, scope, scope

No project can succeed without a clear intent. Lack of a concrete intent leads to two things. First, a constant deviation from what you were trying to build at a certain point in time; and second, it results in producing low-quality pieces of work that try (and fail) to achieve way too many things at once.

## Maybe look over your... scope (again)

Finding myself in a situation where I constantly felt the need to make little tweaks, over time, I ended up with a final product that was almost unrecognisable when compared to initial concepts.

After a while, I realised something— I was diverging, not converging onto a single goal. 

Again, lacking a clear, concise intent led me to branch out in many different directions and continually produce things I absolutely hated.

## Frustration is your friend

Reflection may bring comfort to some, making you feel that you're learning from your mistakes, and that you're improving.

Perhaps you're right— or perhaps you're lying to yourself.

Learning from mistakes takes a very heavy, conscious effort and constant awareness— things which are very difficult to maintain. Particularly when working alone, it's easy to become entrapped in a cycle of repeating the same mistakes.

That cycle, however, will begin to break down quicker and quicker, as frustration begins to set in more and more. Being unhappy with your work is what gives "learning from mistakes" any real meaning.
