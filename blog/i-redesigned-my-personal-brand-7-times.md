## This post is a work in progress.

Building a brand for yourself is a challenging task. In fact, I'd confidently place it as the single most difficult project I have worked on as a designer.

**But why?**

When tasked with 'creating an identity,' as a designer, you are presented with a client brief. Their 'values' and 'culture' define the 'identity' with which they want to be perceivedâ€” your only job then becomes translating from vision to visuals.

Something we might fail to recognise is that deriving this vision of how we want to be perceived is perhaps the most challenging part of the whole process.
